Project Description:

Even in our small community we are flooded with emails, posters and other ads for various events on campus. Our lives would be much easier and better served if there were some system that brings all of these events together. This semester we want to focus on making this goal a reality by building the Ultimate Scheduler (tentative name). This mobile app will consolidate all events on campus (club activities, sports, FAE’s, etc.) in one common place. One aspect of this app that we intend to bring out is personalization and recommendation of events tailored to each individual user. Another aspect we will incorporate is social promotions. Not only will you be able to see an event, but also you will be able to comment, promote, or upload pics/videos via facebook and twiter. This way you can be sure an event you are interested in is worth the hype. 

Project Requirements:

Consolidation of various events around campus in one convenient mobile app.
Personalization of event based off of users interest in past events or settings.
Social interaction between users about specific events.
Users can review an event.
Upload pictures or videos of an event.
Comment on and event.
Connect social aspect with twiter and facebook.
